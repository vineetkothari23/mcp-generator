# OpenAPIEnhancedGenerator Refactoring Progress

## Goal
Refactor `OpenAPIEnhancedGenerator` to use a cleaner, more modular architecture:

1. Use `OpenAPIClientGenerator` to create client code
2. Use `mcp_tool_mapper.py` to generate/enhance `MCPProjectConfig` from the outputs of `OpenAPIClientGenerator`
3. Use `MCPGenerator` to generate MCP server and client code using the enhanced `MCPProjectConfig`

## Analysis of Current Issues

### Redundancy Between MCPIntegrationConfig and mcp_tool_mapper.py
- `MCPIntegrationConfig`: Contains configuration for tool generation (naming conventions, limits, features)
- `MCPToolMapper`: Actually performs the mapping from operations to tool definitions
- **Problem**: Some functionality overlaps and configuration is scattered
